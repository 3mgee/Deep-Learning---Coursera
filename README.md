# Deep-Learning---Coursera
I'm new to git so excuse the inevitable goofups and clumsy formatting. This is a place for me to keep my Jupyter notebooks that I'm creating while doing this course

I'll be using the following nomenclature to store the files (mostly cos i have no idea how to create subfolders):

<Course#>_<Week#>_<assignment#>_<Name>

26/12/17 - Finished 2 of the 5 courses!! :)
